### How to test it

1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml` in your repo
2. Commit and push it to any branch
3. Go to your repo on GitHub → **Actions** tab
4. You should see the workflow running — click into it to see the output

You can also trigger it manually anytime via the **Actions** tab → select the workflow → click **"Run workflow"** (that's what `workflow_dispatch` enables).

### Expected output in the Actions log
```
Hello World! GitHub Actions is working!
Repository: your-username/your-repo
Branch: main
Triggered by: your-username
Event: push
